# fishdle
## Backstory
"fishdle" is basically the famous New York Times "Wordle". But, instead of using everyday words, fishdle uses names of fish! Of course, for those who don't play wordle, your overarching goal is to find the hidden word through guessing and logic!

## How to play! 
* User enters a five or six letter word, preferebly a name of a fish followed by an "enter" or "return" via a keyboard
  * The length of your guessed word depends on the length of the hidden word 
* If the word provided is a valid fish name you will recieve the following feedback:
  * Black Tile: Letter is not in the word
  * Yellow Tile: Letter is in the word but not in the right position
  * Green Tile: Letter is in the word and in the right position
* You have six attempts to find the "_Catch of The Day_"

## What I want for ðŸ«µ
* An "OH YEAH!" in your deepest voice when you guess the word correctly
* A mind-bending, orgasmic and life-changing experience enough to start a mid-life crisis after every guess 
* You can also google if you don't know any fish. But you get a "tsk tsk" from mama.
