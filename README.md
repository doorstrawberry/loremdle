# loremdle
## Backstory
"loremdle" is basically the famous New York Times "Wordle". But, instead of using everyday words, loremdle uses words from the placer text generator "lorem ipsum"! Of course, for those who don't play wordle, your overarching goal is to find the hidden word through guessing and logic!

## How to play! 
* User enters a five letter word, followed by an "enter" or "return" via a keyboard
  * The length of your guessed word depends on the length of the hidden word 
* If the word provided is valid you will recieve the following feedback:
  * Black Tile: Letter is not in the word
  * Yellow Tile: Letter is in the word but not in the right position
  * Green Tile: Letter is in the word and in the right position
* You have six attempts to find the "_missing lorem_"

## What I want for ðŸ«µ
* An "OH YEAH!" in your deepest voice when you guess the word correctly
* A mind-bending and life-changing experience enough to start a mid-life crisis after every guess 
* No googling >:( 

## Tools used
* HTML5
* CSS
* Vanilla JS
